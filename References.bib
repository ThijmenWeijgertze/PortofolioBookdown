  abstract = {Plasmids can horizontally transmit genetic traits, enabling rapid bacterial adaptation to new environments and hosts. Short-read whole-genome sequencing data are often applied to large-scale bacterial comparative genomics projects but the reconstruction of plasmids from these data is facing severe limitations, such as the inability to distinguish plasmids from each other in a bacterial genome. We developed gplas, a new approach to reliably separate plasmid contigs into discrete components using sequence composition, coverage, assembly graph information and network partitioning based on a pruned network of plasmid unitigs. Gplas facilitates the analysis of large numbers of bacterial isolates and allows a detailed analysis of plasmid epidemiology based solely on short-read sequence data.Gplas is written in R, Bash and uses a Snakemake pipeline as a workflow management system. Gplas is available under the GNU General Public License v3.0 at https://gitlab.com/sirarredondo/gplas.git.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

More than a video, you'll learn hands-on coding \& quickly apply skills to your daily work. --- Hello, I'm Richard Erickson. I'm a data scientist. Welcome to this DataCamp course on generalized linear models in R. During this course, you'll expand your regression toolbox by learning about generalized linear models or GLMs for short. In chapter 1, you'll see a review of linear models, learn about their limitations, and see how GLMs overcome some of these limitations. You'll also learn about Poisson regression, a type of GLM. In chapter 2, you'll learn how to run binomial regressions. In chapter 3, you'll learn about interpreting and plotting GLMs. In Chapter 4, you'll learn how to do multiple regression with GLMs. Now, let's see how GLMs compare to other models you likely know. Linear models are a workhorse in data science and include common tools such as linear regression, ANOVAs, and t-tests. They are used for everything from sports-analytics to chemistry. Personally, I use them daily to analyze data. LMs seek to explain variability by estimating coefficients for predictor variables. Intercepts model "average" or baseline effects of predictors. Slopes model changes caused by continuous predictors. The equation to predict y has an intercept beta-not, slope beta1, x, and error epsilon. You can fit linear models in R with the lm() function. Notice how linear models take the formula as the 1st input and data as the second. The tilde may be read as "predicted by", for example, y is predicted by x. Linear models have important assumptions. By definition, the model examines linear relationships, such as the top example plot. Additionally, linear models assume residuals are normally distributed, such as the right plot. Furthermore, linear models work best with continuous repose variables, such as the data on the left. However, in real life, many datasets do not meet these assumptions. The ChickWeight dataset works well with linear models. The dataset compares the weights of chicks fed four diets through time. I've grabbed the last observed weights and plotted the chick weights at the end of the study. In the next slide, you'll see how to fit a linear model to this data. The datasets package contains the ChickWeights dataset. I've saved the last observations as ChickWeightEnd. We will see if the diet explains weight. Specifically, a linear model can examine if the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th diets differ from the 1st diet. Using the linear model function, we use the formula "Weight is predicted by diet" with our ChickWeightEnd data. This model estimates a global intercept (Intercept), which corresponds to the average weight of a chick receiving the 1st diet, as well as the differences for the other diets.  In this case,diets 2, 3, and 4 had chicks with higher weights than diet 1 by the amounts shown on the screen. However, what about other end points? For example, what if we have survival or count data? Survival is binary and counts are discrete. Neither of these are continuous, hence linear models are not a good choice! We need a new tool: The generalized linear model! Linear models can be extended or generalized to become generalized linear models or "GLMs" for short. Specifically, GLMs can have non-normal errors or distributions, although there are limitations to the possible distributions. For example, we can use a Poisson family for count data, which we will see later in this chapter. Or, we can use a binomial family for binary data such as survival data, which we will see in chapter 2. GLMs also have non-linear link functions, which links the regression coefficients to the distribution and allows the linear model to be generalize. We will explore link functions in chapter 2. GLMs are fit with the function glm(). Like lm()s, glm()s have formulas and data as inputs, but also have a family input. The Gaussian family is how R refers to the normal distribution and is the default for a glm(). Also, if the family is gaussian, then a glm() is the same as a lm(). Now that you've seen a little bit about GLMs, let's use them with some data! \#DataCamp \#RTutorial \#GeneralizedLinearModelsinR}

Emerging evidence suggests a crucial role of metabolic reprogramming in the infection's long-term consequences. This study employs a novel approach utilizing machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze metabolic alterations in COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 patients. By integrating ML with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, we aimed to uncover metabolomic signatures and identify potential biomarkers for these conditions. Our analysis included a cohort of 142 COVID-19, 48 Post-COVID-19 samples and 38 CONTROL patients, with 111 identified metabolites. Traditional analysis methods like PCA and PLS-DA were compared with advanced ML techniques to discern metabolic changes. Notably, XGBoost models, enhanced by SHAP for explainability, outperformed traditional methods, demonstrating superior predictive performance and providing different insights into the metabolic basis of the disease's progression and its aftermath, the analysis revealed several metabolomic subgroups within the COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 conditions, suggesting heterogeneous metabolic responses to the infection and its long-term impacts. This study highlights the potential of integrating ML and XAI in metabolomics research.},

In this work, we present an improved method to reconstruct E. coli plasmids using short reads. We developed plasmidEC, an ensemble classifier that identifies plasmid-derived contigs by combining the output of three different binary classification tools. We showed that plasmidEC is especially suited to classify contigs derived from ARG plasmids with a high recall of 0.941. Additionally, we optimized gplas, a graph-based tool that bins plasmid-predicted contigs into distinct plasmid predictions. Gplas2 is more effective at recovering plasmids with large sequencing coverage variations and can be combined with the output of any binary classifier. The combination of plasmidEC with gplas2 showed a high completeness (median=0.818) and F1-Score (median=0.812) when reconstructing ARG plasmids and exceeded the binning capacity of the reference-based method MOB-suite. In the absence of long-read data, our method offers an excellent alternative to reconstruct ARG plasmids in E. coli.},

Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies DNA sequencing platforms generate long reads that can produce complete genome assemblies, but the sequencing is more expensive and error-prone. There is significant interest in combining data from these complementary sequencing technologies to generate more accurate "hybrid" assemblies. However, few tools exist that truly leverage the benefits of both types of data, namely the accuracy of short reads and the structural resolving power of long reads. Here we present Unicycler, a new tool for assembling bacterial genomes from a combination of short and long reads, which produces assemblies that are accurate, complete and cost-effective. Unicycler builds an initial assembly graph from short reads using the de novo assembler SPAdes and then simplifies the graph using information from short and long reads. Unicycler uses a novel semi-global aligner to align long reads to the assembly graph. Tests on both synthetic and real reads show Unicycler can assemble larger contigs with fewer misassemblies than other hybrid assemblers, even when long-read depth and accuracy are low. Unicycler is open source (GPLv3) and available at github.com/rrwick/Unicycler.},
